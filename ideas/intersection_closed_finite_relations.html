        <h1>Intersection closed finite relations</h1>

        <p>This idea is a continuation of the <a href="finite_functions.html">finite functions</a> </p>

        <p>This idea was motivated by trying to intersect the finite functions, to get new ones.
        And also a better way to develop software, by intersecting simple functions, to get a complex one.</p>

        <p>What this algebra needs, is to be closed by intersection, that means if we intersect two elements 
        of this algebra it needs to get an element of the algebra.</p>

        <p>The following intersections cannot be expressed by the finite functions:</p>

        <p>pp = p1 ∩ p2</p>

        <p>⊥ = i1 ∩ i2</p>

        <p>so we will introduce it to the algebra.</p>

        <p>The new algebra will look like (IntFinRel; _._, <_,_>, [_,_], id, p1, p2, pp, i1, i2, dr, ⊥)</p>

        <h2>pp</h2>

        <p>This is a partial function that can be expressed by the relation {(a, (a, a)) | a ∈ A}, 
        and can be thought as the converse of < id, id > or the special projection that forces the 
        two elements to be the same</p>

        <p>Has the property of:</p>

        <p>pp . < R, S > = R ∩ S</p>

        <h2>⊥</h2>

        <p>This relation is called bottom and is the empty relation</p>

        <p>Has the property of:</p>

        <p>R . ⊥ = ⊥ = ⊥ . R</p>
        
        <h2>Classes of this algebra</h2>

        <p>
        (1) [ _, _ ] . dr . < _, _ ><br>
        (2) i* . < _, _ > <br> 
        (3) i* . dr . < _, _ > <br> 
        (4) [ _, _ ] . p* <br> 
        (5) [ _, _ ] . dr . p* <br> 
        (6) i* . p* <br> 
        (7) i* . dr . p* <br> 
        (8) ⊥
        </p>
        <h2>Proof that is closed to intersection</h2>

        <p>To prove this, we need to show that for every intersection between IntFinRel we can 
        represent without ∩, and we can do it by "implementing" ∩.</p>
