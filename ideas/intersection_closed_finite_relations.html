        <h1>Intersection closed finite relations</h1>

        <p>This idea is a continuation of the <a href="finite_functions.html">finite functions</a> </p>

        <p>This idea was motivated by trying to intersect the finite functions, to get new ones.
        And also a better way to develop software, by intersecting simple functions, to get a complex one.</p>

        <p>What this algebra needs, is to be closed by intersection, that means if we intersect two elements 
        of this algebra it needs to get an element of the algebra.</p>

        <p>The following intersections cannot be expressed by the finite functions:</p>

        <p>pp = p1 ∩ p2</p>

        <p>⊥ = i1 ∩ i2</p>

        <p>so we will introduce it to the algebra.</p>

        <p>The new algebra will look like (IntFinRel; _._, <_,_>, [_,_], id, p1, p2, pp, i1, i2, dr, ⊥)</p>
