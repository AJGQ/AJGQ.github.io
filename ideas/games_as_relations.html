<h1 class="title">Games as Relations</h1>
</header>
<p>We can see a game as a relation with type GameState -&gt; GameState .</p>
<pre><code>type Game = Rel GameState GameState</code></pre>
<p>It can be seen as a graph between states of the game, for example in the game of chess, the game state would be the board and its pieces, in a given moment.</p>
<p>Let’s say that a player before a game is programmed to play in a specific way, wich means, that for a specific <strong>GameState</strong> the player will play a specific valid move. That player would be undistinguichable from a normal player, without taking into account the pressure of the moment. This “programable player” can be modeled pretty nicelly. with only a function between game states, we can also call it a <strong>Strategy</strong>, because all that player does is execute a strategy.</p>
<p>Lets call <strong>ContinueState</strong> to the game states wich have at least one move to another state in the game.</p>
<pre><code>type Strategy = ContinueState -&gt; GameState</code></pre>
<p>For simplicity sake, we will say that there is no ties. A player loses a game, when it reaches a state that is not a ContinueState. Let’s call it <strong>EndState</strong>.</p>
<p>Be aware that a game to exist, only needs its rules, without the initial state. for example if you give a jumbled chess board to two player and say, play chess with the normal rules. They will play it (after they decide wich one is who).</p>
<p>With this, it can be proven that a strategy can win and lose to other strategies. And, in some cases, can be constructed a relation between strategies, to say what strategy is the best,</p>
