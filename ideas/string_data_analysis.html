		<h1> String Data Analysis </h1>

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>

        <p>I'm discovering about program analysis, with that comes data analysis and with simple examples of data analysis, comes
        boundary value analysis.</p>

        <p>Boundary value analysis is a technique to have for each instance of a variable in a program, a par of values, the 
        smallest and the biggest possible value of that variable at that instance.</p>

        <p>There exists also the analysis to get all the values modulo a number.</p>

        <p>That made me think if it existed also other simple properties for other types. for integers, floats, chars, etc it's pretty obvious,
        but one that made me really curious was string, because we have a good way to represent alot of variety in strings, it's called
        regular expressions</p>

        <h2> Technique </h2>

        <p>...</p>
